Maybe a very young girl would like it? The overly sweet scent aside, the candle is long lasting, even burning  and has a strong throw - typical of most Yankee candles. The decorative large glass jar with the heavy lid that seals is very giftable. The candle came safely packaged inside an egg crate box within another Yankee box. The candle scent was so strong, I could smell it through both shipping boxes."	FALSE

I was juusst about to buy another brand which was going to cost me $15 for only 6 ounces (should have stuck with that choice). However, I found some Yankee Candles at a good price. Received my \"Pink Sands\" candle fast! (happy/excited) But what a BIG disappointment! Absolutely \"No scent\" from my candle? And No, I don't have Covid (lol) Usually you can smell at least a slight scent during the unboxing stage. Even when removing the lid, still no scent? That should have been a hint. However, I thought \"maybe\" I needed to burn it to smell it. Still nothing? Placed it in a small bathroom with the door closed for about 15 min, still no scent? Tested on two other people ~ same result. Is it possible I got a \"DUD\"? Maybe it is old?  I don't need an expensive emergency \"power outage\" candle. What a waste of money! Unsatisfied Customer here for sure! Even though it said it was new on the listing, It \"seems\" like it was maybe a return? And I'm sure if it was, it was due to the same problem. Unfortunately, you can only return the candle in new or unused condition. All the favorite Yankee Candle scents that YouTubers put in their top/favorite lists like, \"Pomegranate Cider\" or \"Pumpkin Wreath\" are recently listed for double compared to what I paid. My candle \"Pink Sands\" was one of the lowest priced Yankee Candles I came across. Now I know why....I gave a rating of at least two stars. 1 for fast shipping and 1 for no broken glass."	TRUE

"4.0"	"Strong Scent, Long Lasting. Recommended."	2020-09-29	"I have bought and used several of these candles in different fragrances, including: Lilac blossoms, Midnight Jasmine, Midsummer‚Äö√Ñ√¥s Night, Pink Sands, and Silver Birch.I have four dogs and one enormous great room, which includes the kitchen, dining area, entry way, living area, and the dogs‚Äö√Ñ√¥ niche where their beds are. So I am always battling the smell to keep the house smelling nice.Overall, I would give this brand of candles 5 stars. Four out of the five fragrances I‚Äö√Ñ√¥ve tried were pleasant smelling, had a strong odor that would fill the large room, and a long life. They were packaged very well (inside their own box) and burn evenly.Here are my ratings for the scents:Lilac: Five stars. Very strong smell. Sweet and flowery. I love lilac but it was a bit much for my taste for the main part of the house.Jasmine: Five Stars (more if I could!). Wonderful scent. Flowery but not over powering. Mellow. Lots of compliments on this one and asking where I got it, etc. Can be hard to find, too. Recommended.Midsummer‚Äö√Ñ√¥s Night. Five Stars. Pleasant, ‚Äö√Ñ√∫soapy‚Äö√Ñ√π smell. Reminds me of what the bathroom smells like after a shower. I loved this scent, but it is nicer for a bathroom than a main room IMO. Recommended.Pink Sands. Two Stars. Very ‚Äö√Ñ√∫pink‚Äö√Ñ√π smelling. Reminded me of bubblegum. Scent was very weak. Could barely smell it at all. Wish I had returned it. Not recommended.Silver Birch. Five Stars. Very ‚Äö√Ñ√∫woodsy.‚Äö√Ñ√π Makes me think of fall/winter. Very pleasant smell for a main room. Recommended.I definitely recommend these candles overall, especially the four scenes above. The Pink Sands candle was such a dud I had to take off a star, but really these are good candles and worth the price."	FALSE

My very expensive coway air purifier that detects noxious smells and turns up accordingly has never been affected by any candles, even when i tried putting them literally a foot away it only turns up when I light or put them out.But this candle made it go off every time.Even then I wouldnt give them such a low star rating. Just thought it worth mentioning because people might not realize the candle is making them feel nauseous if that is the case.The reason I am writint this is because the candle was listed at beinf 35+ hours. And while I dont time it. I did not that my 10 hour candle lasted a lot longer than this thing did.Keep in mind these are mostly oppinions. Not actual facts if you want to be technical. The candle itself smelled very nice I thought.But for the price they charge, and given my experience?

I normally buy the large jars but since the COVID stuff is going on, I couldn't afford the large jar. Next time, I will wait and spring for the large jar because this small tumbler does not do the scent justice. Even though we only place it in an average sized bathroom.The large jar that is placed in my bathroom will throw the scent in the bathroom and spew out into our entire master bedroom sized room very well and very strong! But this small tumbler barely fills just our bathroom. I assumed it would still saturate the bathroom but it did not. It was very weak. Maybe this yankee candle scent only works well in a larger jar than smaller jar.It did arrive with the wick not centered. It was a pain in the ass. We had to push the un-melted wax side down after each burn to even it out. But it still burned uneven and made more of a mess than tranquility. We contacted yankee candle directly and they did respond fast and did reimburse us, which was nice and surprising since some companies just say oh well too bad. That was the best part of this small tumbler experience.If you like yankee candle or have a favourite yankee candle scent. Get the largest jar for the best scent throw.

They both burned slow and I could almost smell them from my living room into  the hallway but not quite and that was after burning the first one for over four hours!  That's a long time to burn in a small apartment and NOT smell it, actually considering there is no door between the living room and the hall... so no, it's not as strong as it should be but stronger than MOST Yankee candles. Pretty much all Yankee candles just don't cut it these days but I do love this scent and as long as I was sitting in the living room on the sofa I LOVEd this scent and really enjoyed it.  As long and I get them on sale, I'm ok with them. I just don't expect much and I don't get too disappointed.  :-O"	FALSE

It was very cold outside and I had the fireplace going for two days straight since it was warmer in the living room and I decided to sleep in there. I also lighted the candle too and it burned for two days straight (not recommended). I did not blow it out once. The glass did not get too hot either. I always feel the candle glass when I burn a candle for a long length of time at once due to the fact that I have had them get too hot and break when the candle gets closer to the bottom of the wick. This candle stayed warm and did not get too hot. I was even able to light it for one more evening after I had it burning for 48 hours straight. When I lit it the 2nd time. I went ahead and let it burn down to the wick feeling the glass every now and then to make sure it wasn't getting too hot. It was fine and burned down to the wick like a good candle should do instead of burning less or half of the wax and then the wick is too short to light any longer. I promise that you will get your moneys worth with this candle. The flame is nice and bright and the smell is amazing. I ordered the Pink Sands, Sun-Drenched Apricot Rose, and the Honey Clementine. I have not burned the Honey-Clementine candle yet. It's a kitchen candle but I will burn it anywhere. All 3 candles that I had purchased were the larger 22 ounce candles. Thank you!

With that said let me say I ordered 2 PINK SANDS scented lg . jar candles for office gifts and they were just as perfect a quality as tho bought in an actual Yankee store.  Stickers were straight, no bubbles, no hair as other reviewer tried to claim was case, filled level, wicks even.  If you are wondering about the scent,  I guess I can best describe it as a sweet mix of those strawberry hard candies, with a pinch of a cotton candy ish smell somehow combined with a light beach scent swirled with suntan lotion, sandalwood laden sand anotherwords ... ABSOLUTELY DELISCIOUS and not too summery that u cant can't burn mid January.  Infact, it helps me erase a little winter depression when I burn.One VERY IMPORTANT thing to remember with these candles for longevity is #1 TRIM WICKS down to 1/8 inch and monitor length. If you are seeing black soot on glass, wicks is TOO long. Also, all good candles recommend you light for 2 to 4 hrs at a time, let cool then trim & re - light. If you do this you will have perfect results.Ps. Never burn last inch or two as glass can crack ... *tip: Scrape out last 2 inches or so with butter knife (can put cool candle in freezer for 10 min. first for less mess) and put in a tart/wax warmer or save to use in one later. It smells amazing, gives u a few tarts worth and more bang for your buck, enjoy!!"	FALSE

I live in Rhode Island & like to burn this on a warm summer evening when the air is still & the windows are open.  You know the nights when there‚Äö√Ñ√¥s no breeze & nothing is really moving; but I don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t need the a/c on.  I light 2 of these on my first floor which is open concept.  They give off the most beautiful, warm, soft gardenia scent.  It‚Äö√Ñ√¥s not heavy or cloying.  It doesn‚Äö√Ñ√¥t choke you.  It‚Äö√Ñ√¥s not super sweet.  You‚Äö√Ñ√¥d think it would be when you smell the candle.  But when you actually light it, it‚Äö√Ñ√¥s just so smooth & pretty.  I‚Äö√Ñ√¥ve had an incredibly hard time finding this scent over the last few years.  I just happened across it on Amazon this summer for a great price & ordered a couple.  I thought they must be seconds or have something wrong w/ them; but, they were in perfect condition.  I couldn‚Äö√Ñ√¥t be happier.  Ô£ø√º√≤√Ñ Amazon comes through again.  If you‚Äö√Ñ√¥ve never tried gardenia, I highly recommend giving it a shot."	FALSE

I love opening the car door on a hot summer day, and that sweet scent greeting my nose.Obviously, when I saw this sale, I thought it was a great deal for such a large candle.However, it was NOT.The candle has a single wick, which use to be adequate in the past with Yankee Candles. They were known for their potency and longevity. You USE to be able to light one of these babies for an hour, and at least half the house would smell delicious for 4 times as long.Not anymore.I don't know who purchased this company, or what ingredients they are skimping on, but they are just NOT THE SAME.You light the candle, and can't even smell it more than 10 inches away! Doesn't even work in a tiny bathroom. There's definitely zero longevity. The scent doesn't permeate the air and travel to the next room, or linger for hours. This candle is no better than an unscented decorative candle from the dollar tree yet costs so much more.Don't buy this is a gift.

I rely heavily on scents and fragrances, and love how they can immediately bring back vivid memories, and transport you to another place. The top note is a light, sweet melon, with a slight citrusy scent. It makes me think of Honeydew and Oranges. The heart is a soft, exotic floral that reminds me of the heady, intoxicating fragrance of the tiare flower. The base is a warm, slightly spicy, musky vanilla. For me, as the scents meld together, it reminds me of the watery, green scent I love so much. It truly does transport you to a secluded beach, the waves lapping at your feet, on an exotic island far away. They sell out quickly at my local supermarket so I always make sure to buy whatever they have in stock so I never run out. The wax tarts are a good size, with at least 24 hours of fragrance with the wax burner never being turned off.

The wicks do not burn brightly for very long (my photos were taken about fifteen minutes into me lighting them) and they are already going down. By the time half an hour hits, the flames are so tiny, I don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t even know how they manage to stay lit. I mean, you could walk past it in a hurry and they blow out. I guess I‚Äö√Ñ√¥ll stick to jar candles from now on. Great fragrance and design and wax quality, but the wicks are awful. I do keep maintenance on my candles, so I know it‚Äö√Ñ√¥s not me overusing the wick without trimming them. Again, I‚Äö√Ñ√¥ll stick to jar candles. Still believe in the Yankee Candle brand.

Smells of course are very subjective but for me this is one I really like.As always, having owned dozens of jar candles and I can tell you this from experience, the drawback with these is you have to be very diligent about keeping the wick trimmed or you end up with soot on your walls/ceiling.

Needed some scented candles for a house being sold (recently renovated and strong paint smells, not very homely) for prior to public inspections. Tried a variety of scented candles but this one was the best by far! Such a delicious scent I don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t want to ‚Äö√Ñ√≤waste‚Äö√Ñ√¥ it on open houses, I want it for myself! So I‚Äö√Ñ√¥m back to buy more. It‚Äö√Ñ√¥s a sweet scent, but also floral. It carried right through the top floor of the house (three bedrooms, 2 bathrooms and a hallway). It‚Äö√Ñ√¥s a delicate apricot scent with a stronger scent of a rich summer rose. I also bought a Gardenia Yankee Candle and that has a much more delicate and floral scent (still with that heady richness of gardenia, but subtler than this one). If you don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t like sweet scents this may not be ideal for you, but if you want a powerful candle with a great throw, this one will be a great choice. Came well packaged, arrived quickly and smells great straight out of the box. Burns well, although a little lack smoke from the flame. Worth it for the scent."	FALSE

I don't think I bothered to read the description of the candle or the reviews, which I normally do, and ordered it simply because of the name and because I like other Yankee Candles. Even though the patchouli is not the main scent, the fact that I noticed it at all was enough for me to dislike it. Also the candle had some hardened bubbles on the top and was not level, like it had melted and was slightly tilted on its side and then hardened in place. Neither of those reasons would have caused me to return this item - just a heads up to anyone who doesn't like either of those things.

I wanted to try something new. To me it smells more like perfume than it does sage and citrus. It is long burning, but burns quite vigorously if left to burn for hours. The wick gets quite long, the flame quite high and then the burning produces a lot of soot. I trim the wick each time I light it.

I noticed that the smell lasts long even after I had extinguished it, and even the days I don't lit it and the container is closed I can still smell the scent. Super high quality and lovely. Highly recommended. NOTE - I have never tested CVD  positive in the two years here in NYC, and never lost my sense of smell."	FALSE

But then we noticed the terrible black soot it left on her home office walls and ceiling...so much for buying another.  She's had dozens of Yankee candles over the years with no issues, and this one was \"Amazon's Choice\" so I went for it.  Simply put, this jar missed the fragrance nozzle on the assembly line.  We're talking basically no lemon, unless you concentrate it in a very small location.  And even then you have to practically singe your eyebrows off leaning into it to smell anything.  Nothing like other Yankee stuff in the past.  Production mistake?  Yankee's new cost-cutting philosophy?  Who knows.  Just $17 wasted.  We'll go back to generic candles bought at the supermarket.

They were shipped and arrived on different days. I‚Äö√Ñ√¥m still trying to understand why. Both candles were shipped poorly. The 1st had the top tapped as if done by an elementary student and thrown in a box. The 2nd appeared to have been taped, but somehow the top became detached and it was shipped in an envelope. What I noticed upon opening the envelope was lack of fragrance. I cleaned away the tape and decided to light the candle and burn for a couple of hours. I was extremely dissatisfied. There was a very faint fragrance and the candle began to burn straight down the center. I‚Äö√Ñ√¥ve purchased this candle in the past. I know how beautiful the fragrance is or should be and these candles last for a long time. The candle that I‚Äö√Ñ√¥ve been using in my bathroom was purchased in November 2019 and while I don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t burn it every day. It is still very fragrant and after a year still has quite a bit of burn time left.

Even with the small size you could easily smell it.I don't know how to describe this scent, other than obviously lemon and lavender. I am a baker and I smell some other pleasing spice in this candle and I LOVE IT!Before negative reviews flood in. This candle in no way smells like any kind of lemon scented cleaner. Not even close! I am so surprised how true to lemon this candle really is. Fresh Cut Roses was previously my #1, for the scent and throw distance. Now Lemon Lavender is!

It smelled amazing when I removed the lid and I couldn't wait to light it. Dreary, drizzly, damp October in New England and this would have made the day a lot more cheery. Right now, 3+ hours of burn time, and it is pretty much just a red, unscented jar candle. I'll keep it for power outages but as far as scenting the house, I suggest Red Apple Wreath - soft apples and cloves (I think. It is definitely not cinnamon - so I'm thinking cloves).

I don't smell any cilantro, unless it's the fresh aspect I smell with the candle. What I do smell when I burn it, is a smell identical to the smell I experience when I cut up a fresh, ripe, very sweet pineapple. That scent is very predominant in this candle. I also smell sweet coconut, but heavier on the pineapple. It's a perfect balance, and definitely a sweet smell, though not at all in a bad way. When I burn it, the throw is strong. I'd say a 7.5 or so, and it fills my room wonderfully. I can't recommend this one enough.

There are times when the lights go out because the power gets interrupted.

We have a nice patio and putting this on our table rather than having lights overhead.  Because this is larger than most jar candles we like that when the wind blows the flame does not flicker and then get blown out.This is also a great gift item that you would be really thanked a lot for giving."

The candle (when lit of course) is very strong, in a good way! My room instantly smells like lavender lemon. Also, the candle burns for a reallllllly long time. I‚Äö√Ñ√¥ve definitely burned it for over 90 hours, and it still has a ways to go before it‚Äö√Ñ√¥s finished. I probably have another 15+ hours left, which is why I just repurchased another candle! I usually don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t ever spend $20 on candles- but with Yankee Candle Lemon Lavender I‚Äö√Ñ√¥ll make an exception. It‚Äö√Ñ√¥s a really clean, fresh, yummy smell. Intoxicating, and appropriate for any time of the year."	FALSE

Reminds me of my Oahu vacation :)The scent is pretty prominent, not the most fragrant of other Yankees that I have, but I would rate it as medium on the fragrant scale. A good choice for someone who gets headaches from strong overwhelming scents.As other Yankees this lasts forever, I have used it quiet a few times now, and it is almost full (see the picture).This candle definitely could make a good gift for someone.I will enjoy it but will not reorder."

The price of this particular candle is too good to pass up!That being said, the jars are the absolute worst for tunneling. I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong because I've researched this and adjusted the amount of time I burn, and still, it tunnels. I bought wicks and melted down all the left over wax, and it made a whole new candle.The scent isn't as strong with the jar candles. I bought a 3-wick before this purchase and the smell of sugar cookies permeates through my apartment. The jar candles just don't have the same fragrance-power. Maybe it's the shape or the fact that there is only one wick going, either way, it's still wonderful to have around. The candle still smells AMAZING and will have your general vicinity smelling similarly amazing, but the scent isn't traveling very far.Despite the couple issues I have with this particular candle, I will likely purchase this again because the sheer value for your money is unbeatable. I also just love the aesthetic of the jar candles. I'd definitely recommend to to anyone searching for an affordable sugar cookie candle, especially if you happen to have some extra wicks on hand (little wick packs are also super easy to find on Amazon)."

Packed well and the candle was in perfect condition for immediate use.  No issues with the wick and the scent is not overpowering but is true to being outdoors surrounded by pine trees. Coming from New England, that is a real compliment to those who create the Yankee Candle scents.  I purchased two as the price offered by Amazon was a good deal and much less than the retain store or the online store.  I checked both and decided to go with Amazon as the online Yankee was overwhelmed and not able to process at two attempts my order and the retail store was low on inventory considering the late date of my purchasing.  I was fortunate to have received on Christmas Eve with no delays in delivery, this is where Prime membership is worth having.  Both candle jars came in their own individual packed box and both boxes were wrapped in a cardboard cushioned cover to protect the glass from breakage in travel than placed into a larger box.

It‚Äö√Ñ√¥s also a very large candle so I don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t think we‚Äö√Ñ√¥ll have a problem with using it to quickly. I think that was kind of a sale point.

(Wish I'd gotten Christmas Cookie.) To me, the Balsam and Cedar is the stronger smelling, but it smells a little more like soap than like a forest or a Christmas tree! The Red Apple Wreath has a lovely scent, but it would have been nice if the scent were a little stronger.The candles do last quite a long time, and thankfully, they burn clean. No nasty dark marks on ceilings or walls. That is a very important point to me. I like the containers, but these candles are so large that you really need a barbecue lighter to light them once they burn down low.Overall, very nice candles that would have been perfect five stars had the scent been up to par, but it just wasn't. This is especially true of my favorite of the two, the Red Apple Wreath. It's so difficult to find a really good scented candle today, and, sadly, these don't really rise to the occasion. Almost, but not quite. I will definitely use them, but I'm disappointed in the lack of a stronger scent."	FALSE

That being said, it‚Äö√Ñ√¥s a big candle for $15 that smells like a fir tree, which is exactly what I was expecting. I can smell it down the hall and it is lasting a while.

Recently I ordered two of my favorite scent. When they arrived, the scent was barely detected. So - I thought this must be a produce defect. Because I love them so much, I returned them. (I rarely if ever return products.) I received two replacements very quickly. Thank you for the good service! HOWEVER, these candles have the same issue. I can burn them for hours and still not even smell the scent. Even when burning, if I hold the candle close, I only detect the very, very slightest scent. It is almost entirely undetectable. So now I again have two of my favorite, hard to find scents (Christmas Wreath), but do not have the pleasure of enjoying the scent of the candle. This is VERY disappointing!

Apparently greed must have killed them like it does so many businesses these days. You get people running the biz that want to start using cheaper quality materials to make more profit, and they raise prices to ridiculous levels because people love their products. Only they don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t realize people aren‚Äö√Ñ√¥t as stupid as they hoped. The people begin to realize that they just aren‚Äö√Ñ√¥t as good as they once were and they are WAY out of the ballpark now for the Quality to Cost ratio. So people try another brand and go wow, that‚Äö√Ñ√¥s a great candle! And they never go back. They then talk to their friends about it and the friends ‚Äö√Ñ√∫wake up‚Äö√Ñ√π and go ‚Äö√Ñ√∫your right, their candles just aren‚Äö√Ñ√¥t that great anymore. Their prices have gotten ridiculous anyway.‚Äö√Ñ√π It is now that they switch too over to that other brand that really knows how to make a great smelling candle, that stays smelling great, until the last bit of life leaves the flame on the wicks.I know for a fact that this happens as stated above. It is from direct experiences on my part, multiple times as well. I even started polling our friends and the majority of them actually verified the same sentiment. That Yankee Candles, which used to be everyone‚Äö√Ñ√¥s favorite, have gone downhill so badly and have gotten so crazy expensive, that it just does not make sense to keep wasting the amount of time I have to work to pay for them. I work hard. I want quality for my money and time. I‚Äö√Ñ√¥m not going to spend an hour working to throw away on garbage. Companies don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t respect the people who work to pay their salaries. The only thing they care about is my money and not the time I slaved at work just to purchase their crappy product. What happened to the days when ‚Äö√Ñ√∫customers come FIRST‚Äö√Ñ√π? They‚Äö√Ñ√¥re gone and now it‚Äö√Ñ√¥s only about taking your money/time and passing it on to the fat executive that‚Äö√Ñ√¥s destroying their brand, just to make themselves and their greedy shareholders fatter and richer off the backs of those who do the REAL work in this world.... just for the privilege of buying their overpriced trinkets."

"1.0"	"Fot those wondering why Yankee Candles seem weak these days, there is a reason...they sold out."	2020-11-08	"I was a long time Yankee Candle buyer since the early 2000s through 2017. I used to buy them in the mall and stock up when they had the buy one get one free deals. My first hint something was wrong was when I bought holiday themed ones during 2016. They just didn't have the same \"throw\" even though I was buying some of the same scents. I thought it a fluke until 2017 holiday season and I knew something was not right. I bought a couple more last holiday season 2019 and they still sucked. I had some unopened ones from 2013 or so and fired one up in another room for comparison. Sure enough, the 2013 jar lit up the room in scent as we all were used to whereas these newer ones were just dead. Bear in mind that was a six year old candle! So, I did some research. You are far from alone if you noticed there isn't the strong \"throw\" of scent the original Yankee Candles had. Here's what one member of a candle website review forum said what's going on in his/her March 2020 post:\"A friend of mine worked at Yankee candles production facility the last 5 years and tells me that a lot has changed. When he started there was hardly any mineral oil used, now its about 40% of each candle. He says its just filler, so they don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t have to use as much wax. They keep upping the % of mineral oil as its a cheap filler and lets them make more per candle. He also says they have changed to a much cheaper scent. They actually have to use more per candle as its so weak, but its way cheaper than the older scent. He says constant cost cutting measures like this are implemented all the time to up the profits per candle. It‚Äö√Ñ√¥s far from the old Yankee Candle.\"^^And there you have it. The new management of Yankee Candle is chasing profits over quality. Like many others, I have found MUCH better value in generic grocery store candles. Such a shame, but that's the beauty of capitalism for you. Someone fails, another fills the void instead of a socialist government telling you that you only have one option that they decide for you."

It lasts about half an hour before the flame has nearly burned out.On the other hand there's a great deal of wonderfully scented candle and I expect it to last a couple months, even burning a few hours a day.

As well, Rugged & Dapper balsam candle is one of the best scents and the glass is beautiful‚Äö√Ñ√ÆI bought one of those for my guy and he loved it; I wanted one for myself but they sold out quick at Christmastime!This Yankee Candle balsam candle didn‚Äö√Ñ√¥t last long. The scent is nice but not quite strong enough. And the glass jars/pillars they come in aren‚Äö√Ñ√¥t ones I really care to leave out to display‚Äö√Ñ√Æthough this pillar was a nicer than the design  I bought for a friend.For the scent comparison with Yankee, I‚Äö√Ñ√¥d rather pay far less and buy Glade, as those scents are just as good as this Yankee Candle Balsam candle for a fraction of the cost.

Rugged & Dapper makes the best forest-scented candle I‚Äö√Ñ√¥ve ever smelled and he loved it and used the entire candle‚Äö√Ñ√Æand the Rugged & Dapper glass jar the candle is in is attractive. This was an in-a-hurry impulse buy when R&D was sold out, though I don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t like the presentation of this Yankee Candle with the old-fashioned jar look; however, balsam & cedar candles are difficult to find.I don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t like this jar‚Äö√Ñ√ÆI wish Yankee Candle did something better with their balsam & cedar scent instead of this old-fashioned jar look. It looks cheap and like something I‚Äö√Ñ√¥d buy at Big Lots. That‚Äö√Ñ√¥s my one disappointment.(Update: I purchased the pillar candle for myself and it is more to my liking than the jar.)As far as the scent, it smells really good! Not quite as good as the Rugged & Dapper candle in the same scent, but the scent is strong enough to permeate the room and give that Christmas-at-time-of-the-year scent. Though Rugged & Dapper edges out Yankee Candle in scent, too.For the money, this is a lot of candle‚Äö√Ñ√Æboth the jar and the pillar I later bought‚Äö√Ñ√Æand will last a long time, and it smells good."

"2.0"	"Yankee Candles just aren‚Äö√Ñ√¥t any good anymore."	2020-01-31	"For a Yankee Candle, and the price I paid, I was very disappointed. The smell was non-existent. I thought Yankee were once the best? Apparently greed must have killed them like it does so many businesses these days. You get people running the biz that want to start using cheaper quality materials to make more profit, and they raise prices to ridiculous levels because people love their products. Only they don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t realize people aren‚Äö√Ñ√¥t as stupid as they hoped. The people begin to realize that they just aren‚Äö√Ñ√¥t as good as they once were and they are WAY out of the ballpark now for the Quality to Cost ratio. So people try another brand and go wow, that‚Äö√Ñ√¥s a great candle! And they never go back. They then talk to their friends about it and the friends ‚Äö√Ñ√∫wake up‚Äö√Ñ√π and go ‚Äö√Ñ√∫your right, their candles just aren‚Äö√Ñ√¥t that great anymore. Their prices have gotten ridiculous anyway.‚Äö√Ñ√π It is now that they switch too over to that other brand that really knows how to make a great smelling candle, that stays smelling great, until the last bit of life leaves the flame on the wicks.I know for a fact that this happens as stated above. It is from direct experiences on my part, multiple times as well. I even started polling our friends and the majority of them actually verified the same sentiment. That Yankee Candles, which used to be everyone‚Äö√Ñ√¥s favorite,  have gone downhill so badly and have gotten so crazy expensive, that it just does not make sense to keep wasting the amount of time I have to work to pay for them. I work hard. I want quality for my money and time. I‚Äö√Ñ√¥m not going to spend an hour working to throw away on garbage. Companies don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t respect the people who work to pay their salaries. The only thing they care about is my money and not the time I slaved at work just to purchase their crappy product. What happened to the days when ‚Äö√Ñ√∫customers come FIRST‚Äö√Ñ√π? They‚Äö√Ñ√¥re gone and now it‚Äö√Ñ√¥s only about taking your money/time and passing it on to the fat executive that‚Äö√Ñ√¥s destroying their brand, just to make themselves and their greedy shareholders fatter and richer off the backs of those who do the REAL work in this world.... just for the privilege of buying their overpriced trinkets."

Then they changed the Label before the latest change it slowly but since the label change the fragrance was never the same.  It became more of a metallic scent and did not have the depth it did for all the years. It seemed like it had been watered down. The most recent pours have been just a ghost of what it once was. I miss burning it during the holidays and have stopped buying it after 20 years of wonderful Christmases.

From day one, it sputtered and sizzled when I tried to light the wick; like there is water in the candle.  I persisted, because I do like the smell, but it hasn't gotten better.  Oftentimes the candle puts itself out. leaving an unpleasant smoke pervading the air.  When I trim the wick, necessary to prevent black smoke when it gets too long, it starts up with the sputtering again when I try to light it.  I've tried putting the candle under a warmer to melt the wax, to pour out some of the wax, to elongate the wick.  This has been a fruitless process.  I've ended up pouring half of the candle out, trying to get it to burn properly.  At this point, the wick is too long.  Black smoke pours off of it when lit.

This is a fantastic scent, but the candle will only fill a small room with a hint of the essence. There are air pockets in the wax which make it glisten and look posh, but that removes what I'm guessing is 10%+ of the volume that could be taken up by solid product. I'm sure it has something to do with the way it's designed to melt and disperse the scent in the large jar, but that's a problem for Engineering. At this point, it's more of a status symbol of how homey your living room is than a functioning scented candle"	FALSE

Give it another four hours, and it still won't. And *another* four hours, and you've got a wax funnel. I've tried stopping trimming every four hours, but that doesn't help. I always end up babying it and holding a charcoal lighter to the glass and/or hard wax, and then using a plastic soon to cultivate the candle. It takes an entire tank of butane and then some.

Admittedly, my husband has a sensitivity to smells, but he was right on this one - it didn't have that fresh pine smell.  It reminded me of the car air fresheners of old that people used to hang on their rear view mirrors.  It is much too strong - and not really the mild pine scent I had anticipated.

Got them, (not in two days, however), and they were safely and well packaged inside a sort of thick cardboard eggcrate packaging.  It kept it from breaking. (I had received one last year which was only wrapped in bubble wrap, and it was broken and unusable.)I Opened these, which were  \"Christmas Cookie\" and \"Home for the Holidays\". They smelled good in the jars and I lit them, one at a time in different rooms.Total disappointment. They don't burn the faintest scent, even when you stand with your nose to them. Right after the flame got longer,  I snuffed them out and trimmed the wicks and relit them, as I have been taught to do. You can smell wax burning--that's it. Also, the lip of the jar is so thin and fragile, you must be very careful trying to fit the top back on. They didn't use to be quite this thin.The one I got as a gift last year was from here, and it was broken in several places at the lip.  I thought, and still do, that it was because it was bubblewrapped carelessly. I used to pay $25 at least for these large candles, and I had to save up to get them! (Still do!)Here I saw these large Yankee Candles, and was thrilled at the price, thinking the prices had finally gone down, for  when I ordered, they were just below $14.00 each.The lable looks the same, so I can't figure if these were somehow cheap knockoffs or what. The scents when you open the top are good--but there's no emittion of that scent while burning. Have Yankee candles diluted their formerly wonderful product? Hopefully not!  Last night, I lit a candle from a large big-box store we all have heard of. It was an off brand that I picked up for eight bucks, and soon it was wafting all over the house. Unfortunately, it smelled like grape soda!There is something very off when Yankee Candles don't do \"their thing\". We live on a fixed income and I rarely buy items of \"luxury\" like this, but these were sort of  my Christmas gift to me! I know in the broad scope of things, this is a rather small thing, but Yankee Candles have never, ever disappointed me!! If you can find a local dealer or can order directly from Yankee Candle's own storer, hopefully they will send you the great product for which they are known.

I am exceedingly disappointed. I expect more from Yankee Candle (a brand that I've personally used in my own home and normally have a high opinion of), I expect better quality for candles that cost more than $10 each.

Or when you put them out you'll see dark smoke that kind of makes you wonder if burning candles is a smart thing to do for your living environment. The minute I began buying these Yankee Candle Company candles I realized they burn very clean and burn for about three times the length of a traditional brand. I bought 3 of these and my large apartment smells like a Christmas cookie but not so strong that the sweetness is overwhelming. I love to relax in bed, with my dog, Logan, at my side, and enjoy the beauty, fragrance and relaxation that only Yankee candle delivers always.

NOPE! This has been an ongoing issue for quite sometime. I've been a YC devotee for over 20 years. However, with this year's shipments I noticed that the candles weren't throwing scent like they used to, and some scents were stronger than others. Harvest and Autumn Leaves are my two go-to scents in the fall. I buy both the jar candles and the wax melts. The candles' scent throw was negligible while the melts emitted a very strong throw. This is neither my imagination nor do I or have or have ever had COVID. This is YC's corporate greed cutting back on the amount of scent they use in their candles now. The company has been sold at least twice now, and the son of the original owner started Kringle Candles which I've started patronizing.Next year, I'll buy the wax melts and hopefully they'll still have good scent throw. However, I will not be buying anymore jar candles from YC. Kringle Candles has brought back the quality of the original YC and I have yet to be disappointed with any of my purchases. YC is going to have to step up their game if the want to staunch the loss of customers they're apparently losing. It ain't COVID nor our imaginations. The quality just sucks now. Such a shame..."

The last one I had was bought about 5ish years ago and cycled seasonly with other Yankee Candles. It definitely always had a cinnamon smell but not like this. This one is almost satirical! This Home Sweet Home candle has such an exaggerated cinnamon smell, it burns the throat to smell it!You'll notice I made a point to let it be known I haven't bought a HSH Yankee candle in about 5 years. I did that incase Yankee has changed the formula to increase the Cinnamon. Or maybe it was a mistake buying on Amazon? Maybe it's a second? Or maybe I am just getting old and my olfactory glands are 'going' first? The only problem with the latter is the previous HSH candle I had was at it's wicks end and I was able to compare. So if it's my olfactory senses, they went haywire overnight.Yankee offers candles with Cinnamon in the name to let it be known cinnamon is what you're going to get. Wow, if they are more 'cinnamony' than this, it would double as a tear gas agent. Just imagine putting a Yankee cinnamon candle on a warmer during the holidays. One could clear out any family or friend visitors from sheer discomfort alone! This HSH is more than half way there.

I noticed there is not a note on this item to report the item that you can click on and select what the problem is and describe it. That is probably because it is sold and shipped by Amazon! I contacted customer service and reported the problems with the description and not agreeing with the product that I received and they said it would be addressed. I keep checking and nothing's changed so my suggestion is first not to order the item in the first place and then if you got it, try it. If it's one from other than USA or real Yankee Candle, return it and Amazon maybe will stop selling it. The one I got came direct from Amazon and not a marketplace seller. The reviews you read are correct, it is a horrible Product with no scent. It just smells like an oily burnt smell it's terrible."	TRUE

Because they're more expensive than others. I explain to them that I have bought other \"knockoffs\" to save money before, only to end up getting exactly what I paid for...wasted wax without any scent at the last 1/3 to 1/4 of the jar Ô£ø√º√≤√≠, so they didn't save me anything.I don't work for the company, but I am a stickler for being well informed, so I know why the Yankee Candles cost more than their competitors... See, other companies only use their scented wax at the top 3/4 or 1/2 of their candle products, the bottom is just colored wax with a hint of scent. This way, they are able to trick the average customer into buying them. Don't get me wrong, at first, they all have great \"throw,\" however, as they burn down, their scent becomes much weaker. Some brands don't even use wicks long enough for their candles, causing them to fizzle out long before they should.Yankee Candle Company uses fully scented wax throughout the entire candle. They also have a high concentration of scented oils, to insure a strong throw of scent, from the first time you light it until it burns all the way down.*** P. S. Make sure you buy the REAL THING, not a cheap knockoff. I noticed that the complaints here are all about the \"Cinnamon Sparkle\" scent. Even though they're listed under the \"Home Sweet Home\" one. I ordered 2 of the \"Home Sweet Home\" scent here, and they're real Yankee Candle brand. If you get a fake one, like some of the other customers, report it to Amazon immediately! Amazon is just a distributor. They'll accept a return, even if your candle is burned to the wick, refund your money, then investigate to persecute the dirty posers!***"	FALSE

"2.0"	"Not Much Scent, Lots Of Soot, Burns Fast"	2020-01-29	"First let me say that my wife and I are Yankee Candle lovers. It is the only brand of candles we purchase. Over the course of many years we have only had a few issues with their products.This was the first time we purchased the Sparkling Cinnamon scented candles which we wanted for the holidays and in regards to this variety they did not throw much scent at all, about halfway burned it started throwing a great deal of soot which was all over our coffee table and ,because of the double wicks, the candles burned twice as fast. This is a trick with every candle maker. The more wicks, the faster they burn and the more often you have to buy new candles. Please keep this in mind when buying candles.I would not recommend purchasing this particular holiday scent, but they have a great many of other high quality candles that we love. Our favorite is the single wick large pillar Midsummer Night scented candles. They give off a great deal of scent, that fragrance is wonderful (in our opinion-of course) and they last a month or more of daily use."	FALSE

On the first, about 1.5 inches from the bottom, the wick burned out because it was folded over and didn't go to the bottom of the candle.  The other one burned with such a low flame that it burned a hole down into the wax without melting half of it.  I've never had this problem with Yankee Candles purchased at a local brick and mortar store for $20+.  Perhaps these $13 units on Amazon are factory rejects?On a positive note, they smelled good.

"5.0"	"A powerful, warm fragrance that projects!"	2018-02-22	"I've been burning Yankee Candles for 25 years. I grew up in S. Deerfield and it's a totally typical thing for people in Western Mass to have tons of Yankee Candles in their homes. They aren't the 'best candles' in the world, but I do like them, especially the stronger spice/woods/gourmand offerings.SCENT: I've gone through several large jars of Kitchen Spice. I get a wonderful blend cranberries, cloves, cinnamon, nutmeg, baked apple and pumpkin. It's a much richer variant of their Pumpkin Spice scent. I like Pumpkin Spice, but it's not strong enough for my taste. If you feel the same, give the Kitchen Spice a try. It's homey, warm, and comforting. It's certainly a fall or winter scent; it reminds me of cool weather holidays, baking with loved ones in a country kitchen, mulled wine, spiced apple cider, warm fires, Halloween decorating and Thanksgiving tables.Regardless of whether I like the scent, I don't rate candles highly unless they fill the entire area, if not my whole house, with fragrance. I buy scented candles to scent. my house and I don't like wasting time with candles that don't cut it. Kitchen Spice is one of the TC offerings that easily fills my house with scent.**Just a TIP for those who have problems with jar candles. When you first burn it, you'll need to let it burn for a while, until the wax pool fully reaches the edge of the jar all the way around. This builds the proper foundation for use. Each subsequent burn, you should also let the wax pool reach the edges fully. This way you get your money's worth out of the candle.**"	FALSE

I have this burning in my kitchen.I need to revise my first rating. After leaving the candle to burn longer, I Went outside for awhile and when I came back in and opened the door , I smelled the scent. I think that in all fairness that I should revise my rating. However that being said, I think that it is just a nice light scent compared to what I am use to. I have for years favored another brand scent for years when I decided to give yankee a chance.

"5.0"	"Worth paying the extra money for Yankee candle"	2016-03-09	"Love this candle!! it had such a great scent.  It made my whole house smell like I was baking fresh apple pies in my kitchen. I never understood why people paid so much for a candle when you could go to Walmart and buy them for half the price. But after purchasing this candle I understand the price difference. There is a much more  Intense aroma with the Yankee candle. Additionally, the candle burns for way more hours than with A cheaper version. This candle just kept burning... I couldn't believe how many hours I got out of it. I am officially converted to a Yankee candle girl. The problem is they have so many great scents to choose from, that want to spend all of my money on candles now!"	FALSE
